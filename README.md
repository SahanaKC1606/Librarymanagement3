# Task 3: Basic SELECT Queries - Library Database

## 📘 Introduction to SELECT

The `SELECT` statement belongs to **DQL (Data Query Language)** and is used to **retrieve data** from one or more tables.

### 🔹 Key Concepts:
- **Projection**: Fetching data from specific columns  
- **Selection**: Fetching data from specific rows using conditions  

### 🔹 Clauses and Features:
- `WHERE`: Filters rows based on conditions  
- `AND`, `OR`: Combines multiple conditions  
- `LIKE`: Enables pattern matching  
- `BETWEEN`: Filters within a range  
- `ORDER BY`: Sorts result set  
- `LIMIT`: Restricts number of returned rows  
- `DISTINCT`: Removes duplicates
